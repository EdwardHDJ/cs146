Assignment 1:

1.My home directory is “/home/dejianh”. I typed “echo $HOME” to see my $HOME
environment variable which stores the path to home directory.  

2.My UID is 61564. I used the command “id -u” to print my UID.  

3.My group is ugrad . I used command “groups” to print the group.  

4.My "kill" character is ^U, it is used for erase the current line.  I find it
by using "stty -a" command.  

5.For remote hosted file system,I used uci odin machine. After I removed execute
permission for directory,I am not allowed to create files. I can't cd into it. I
can't ls it. I can't "ls -l" it.  I don't have a Linux system or virtual
mahcine,so I used WSL. After I removed the execution permission,I can't create
file in it. I can't "cd" into it. I can't "ls" it.I can't 'ls -l" it.  

6.Creating a hard link and removing the original file won't remove the actual
content since the hard link is still connecting to the actual file in disk. Hard
link is just important as the original link,so only the inode of original file
will be deleted not the content of file in disk.  Deleting the symbolic file
will not delete the actual content because a symbolic link is just a refernce to
another file, so only reference will be removed rather than the content.

7."mv" a directory is possible, I successfully moved a directory to another
directory using command "mv <source> <destination>. "cp" a directory is not
allowed, unless "-r" option is specified.

8.There are 71 mounted file system on odin.ics.uci.edu. I used command "mount |
wc -l" to check how many lines are in the mount result. There are 71 lines and
each line correspond to a mounted file system.

9.I used command "ls -l /dev/pts | grep dejianh" to get all the tty I used. I
find the anme of my log in terminal is "pts/5".   


10.FFDC to binary should be 11111111 11011100. MOVE is 1100101. 
MUL is 1010001 01011101.
